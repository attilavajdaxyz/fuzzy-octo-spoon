		<h1>Making sens of weeklies.</h1>
		
		<p>
			This project is built on the idea that I was wondering how to make use of weeklies that I subscribed toand are probably very useful, but I never really read them until now. So I have been working on the Artist's Way method for thelast five days and I really have been enjoying it. The morning papers are encouraging in situtations where I would get stuck about writing or making something creative. Especially the blurts and practicing making and writing affirmations is particularly helpful. "Oh don't write about this about all this nonsense and etc" and I can turn it into "Oh yes write this down and it is good and very positive effect on your mind and overall wellbeing!" - "thank you". Hundred Years of Solutide is very funny and sad. Sooooooooo weeklies. UX design weekly. Ctrl + alt + cmd + Space inverses the colors of the screen. "Dis Siri, inverser le couleurs d'ecran, s'il vous plait!" are two useful functions for accessibility and preserving one's sight. Reading from the command line with black background and white characters is very cool.
