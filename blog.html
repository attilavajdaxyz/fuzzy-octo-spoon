Reading Eloquent JavaScript bite sized - taking notes so that notes are effective and feel good and recycled. After each paragraph I could do a recall in writing! Perhaps it will suck at first, but what happens when I do this for a whole year? Effortless.

Objects. I read about objects. Identity. A const is immutable, but the contents of a const object can be changed. Strings are immutable. Â«Â catÂ Â» cannot be changed to Â«Â ratÂ Â» .

Cultivating success that leads to motivation. Curiosity. To know when it is enough. And to be content with enough.
